# EE Security Quickstart with JBoss EAP 8

The `ee-security` quickstart demonstrates Jakarta EE security.

## What is it?

The `ee-security` quickstart is an example project showing the use of Jakarta EE security in JBoss EAP 8.

The deployment in this quickstart contains a simple HTTP servlet, which is secured using a custom HttpAuthenticationMechanism. The authentication mechanism in turn makes use of a custom IdentityStore.

This quickstart is hard coded to work with a user `quickstartUser` with password `quickstartPwd1!`.
