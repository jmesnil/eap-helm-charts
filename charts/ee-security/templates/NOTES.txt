The application can be accessed from the route created by this chart on the `/secured` HTTP endpoint

If you attempt to access that URL, you will see "Unauthorized".

To see and manipulate the HTTP headers within the HTTP requests, it is recommended to use a client like `curl` to invoke the servlet.

----
$ curl -v <route url>/secured
...
< HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
< Connection: keep-alive
< X-MESSAGE: Please resubmit the request with a username specified using the X-USERNAME and a password specified using the X-PASSWORD header.
----

This first request shows the client is being prompted to authenticate. The `X-MESSAGE` header is providing additional information as to how the client can achieve this.

The request can now be submitted with the previously added user.
